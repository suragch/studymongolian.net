# About

StudyMongolian.net is a site to help people learn Mongolian as it is spoken and written in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. The siteâ€™s author lives and works in Inner Mongolia and studies Mongolian in his free time. The teachers who record the lessons are all from Xilingol League, which is where the Mongolian language is considered to be the most standard in Inner Mongolia.

This site does not attempt to teach the Khalkha dialect or the Cyrillic script that are used in the county of Mongolia to the north. However, one could learn Mongolian from this site and still be able to communicate with speakers of the Khalkha dialect.

If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions then please [contact me](/contact/).
