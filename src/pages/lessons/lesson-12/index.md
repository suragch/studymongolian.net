:::note Notes
Have we talked about the /iː/? The word it follows is the object of the verb. Sometimes it is left out when talking about something in general, but it is especially used when referring to a specific object. We see this in /bi ən xɔbʧə̌s iː ɑbjɑː/. I'll get *this* article of clothing.

:::note Notes
- gəʤ bæːnɑː can also be pronounced gəʤinɑː
- As I understand it, gəʤ bæːn expresses the speakers intent to do something, whereas bɔdə̌ʤ bæːn is more thinking about or wanting to do something. gəʤ itself is some sort of connecting word.

Your website has been so amazingly helpful and i can’t thankyou enough for the helpful audio as well. I see you last updated in 2015. I wonder where you are now, i really hope you can come back to updating this website again. There’s is so much to know.

> I actually have the lessons all recorded through lesson 20. It takes about 10 hours of work to do the editing for every lesson, though, so I haven’t gotten around to it. For the past couple years I’ve spent more of my time developing Mongolian cell phone software like the Chimee app. I’m also continuing my own private Mongolian study. It helps to know that people like you are actually using the lessons so hopefully that will be a motivation to get some more out.

> You can view the unfinished lessons by typing the lesson number in the page address. For example, lesson 13 is [http://www.studymongolian.net/lessons/lesson-13/](http://www.studymongolian.net/lessons/lesson-13/). When I finish the lessons I will add links in the menu.
