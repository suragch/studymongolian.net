:::note Notes
/xədə̌n/ (or /xədnæː/ or /xəd/) is the word for "how many". It is used with questions about numbers.

Like the months, the days of the week are easy in Mongolian. Monday is "week + 1", Tuesday is "week + 2", and so on. Sunday is the exception. It can be said "week + 7" but is usually said "week + day".

As you can see in Substitution 3, the /-n/ verb ending can be used to say what you are going to do in the future.

The /-jɔː/ ending (or /-jɑ, -jə, -ju, etc. as the case may be) can be used to make a suggestion, as in "Let's do something." We can see this in Substitution 4.

## Grammar

### Word Order

By now you have probably already noticed that the verbs come last in the sentence. If the verb has an object then the object goes in front of the verb. If we were to use the same order in English then we would get sentences like

- I food eat.
- I book read.
- I letter write.
- I friend visit.

Of course, in English this is poor grammar, but in Mongolian it is perfectly fine. In fact, to use the English grammatical order in Mongolian would be be wrong. They say that Koreans and Japanese can learn Mongolian fairly easily because their grammar is similar. For native English speakers it doesn't feel natural at first, but with practice we can get used to it, too.

See Substitution 3 above for examples of this word order.

## Practice

How do you say the following words:

- how many
- what
- days of the week
- yesterday, today, tomorrow
- morning, afternoon, evening
- birthday
- age
- do
- read
- watch
- listen
- visit
- book
- song
- letter

How do you say the following sentences:

- What day (of the week) is today?
- What day (of the month) was yesterday?
- Tomorrow is Friday.
- When is your birthday?
- What are you doing tonight?
- Let's watch TV, okay?
- Are you going to their place?
- What day is Sunday?
- Answer the above questions.

Review by saying the following:

- Let me give an introduction.
- How are your parents?
- I’m going to the internet cafe tomorrow.
- Hello.
- Are your parents busy?
- Where are you going?
- Goodbye.

If you were able to say most of these things correctly then you are ready to go on to [lesson seven](/lessons/lesson-7/). If not, then keep practicing! You can also download the audio for the whole lesson so that you can practice listening while going to school. Click the three-dot menu at the right of the audio player below and choose "Download".

I know I keep asking alot of questions but that is a way to learn. I was wondering since the verbs go at the end of the sentence why did bol go before the another word in the sentence a couple of lessons ago, as in “Bi bagsh bishe, bi bol suregsh”. Thanks.

> I had to look this one up in my grammar book. I guess /bɔl/ isn’t technically considered a verb. It is a connecting particle (or Focus Particle, as my grammar book says.). It connects the subject of the sentence with its complement. It functions similarly to the English linking verb “to be”. However, unlike “is, am, are”, you can’t conjugate /bɔl/. (There is a similar verb /bɔl-/ (to become) and that one can be conjugated at the end of the sentence.)

**London Park** on November 23, 2013 at 5:39 am

Thank you so much! That makes alot more sense. Also in the vocabulary list it has bɔl meaning to be okay. How do you tell the difference between that and bɔl to become?

> The verb /bɔl-/ can mean “okay” or “to become” depending on the context. It is a commonly used verb with a few different meanings. I forgot that in our lessons so far it has only meant “okay”.

Hi, thanks for your effort on this online course, I really learned a lot!
Just 1 question, when we say “to read a book”, why say “nɔm ʊŋʃə̌n” instead of “nɔmig ʊŋʃə̌n”? I thought nɔm should be the object here.

> **Suragch** on August 20, 2020 at 1:21 pm

> As I understand it, when talking about reading a book in general you say “nɔm ʊŋʃə̌n” but if you were talking about a specific book, like this book, you’d say “ən nɔmig ʊŋʃə̌n”.
