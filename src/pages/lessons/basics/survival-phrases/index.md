I liking the phrases a lot. Some of the content is difficult to say. Oh I have two request- could you also put it in Cyrillic and could you add phrases for dating?

Neither I nor my Mongolian teachers have the knowledge to add Cyrillic to the lessons. Check out the [links](http://www.studymongolian.net/links/) page, though, for some good sites that teach Mongolian with Cyrillic.

Could you tell me:
1)how to address a waiter or waitress to bring me the bill after I have eaten at the restaurant?
1) how to tell the taxi driver to take me to Ganden Monastery? to the airport?

> **Suragch** - February 12, 2014 at 2:31 pm
> 
> 1) In Inner Mongolia in small Mongolian restaurants you usually just go to the counter and ask “xədiː jɔːs be?” (see above). You could call the waiter or waitress (uilʧə̌lə̌gʧəː) and ask the same question.
> 2) My teachers aren’t here now so for now I’ll just give you my non-expert answer and try to update this at some later date. If it were me I would say “____ ɔʧnɔː” (go to ____) and then put the location in the blank. Sorry, this answer is not very good. I like your idea of having taxi survival phrases, though, so I’ll add that some time.

The language spoken here is quite the same as one in Mongolia itself, although written language is in different script. Oh by the way, the ‘b’ in Mongolian language is quite allophonic in nature. Is letter ‘b’ originated from one letter in Traditional Mongolian script? I see that many times ‘be’ are pronounced as ‘ve’ except when it follows ‘n’ or ‘m’ such as ‘hen be’, otherwise ‘ju be’ sounds like ‘ju ve’. In Cyrillic script, this is explicitly write out as “вэ/бэ” to show sound difference although they mean the same thing.

> **Suragch** - September 24, 2014 at 11:18 pm
> 
> Thank you for pointing that out. I just use /b/ in the phonetic transcriptions for simplicity’s sake.

What would you like to eat? tɑː juː idxiː

It is an interrogative question. Shouldn’t there be question particle ‘be’?
tɑː juː idxiː be

> **Suragch** - September 24, 2014 at 11:15 pm
> 
> As I understand it, the final /iː/ of /idxiː/ is actually a spoken form of “be”.

in outer mongolia (mongolia proper), I never heard sæːn ʊː? as a greeting… I heard bæːn ʊː? as a common greeting.

> **Suragch** - January 12, 2018 at 2:30 am
> 
> sæːn ʊː is used synonymously with sæːn bæːn ʊː in Inner Mongolian and both are equally common.

Hi. Do you have some kind of higher form of “thank you” as “Appreciate that” or Thank you very much?

> **Suragch** - May 19, 2018 at 5:52 am
> 
> You can add words like “very” or “much” to “thank you.” For example, someone recently told me, “ᠮᠠᠰᠢ ᠶᠡᠬᠡ ᠪᠠᠶᠠᠷᠯᠠᠯ᠎ᠠ” (mɑʃ jix bɑjɑrlɑː).

No Download for this page???? Please, if you can enable downloads of these audio files, that would be very useful.

> That’s a good idea. I should add a link to the page. For now, though, you can download the Anki flashcard deck. I’m pretty sure it includes the audio.
