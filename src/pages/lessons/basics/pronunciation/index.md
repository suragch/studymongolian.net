# Pronunciation

Pronunciation of the basic sounds is important to get a grasp on at the beginning of our language study. It isn't easy to distinguish and reproduce these new sounds, but we will have a much better communication experience in the future if we can master them now.

There doesn't seem to be any standard way of romanizing the Mongolian sounds with English letters, so we will be using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to represent them. (The IPA symbols that are used here are the same as in the *Mongolian in Seven Weeks* textbook. Linguistically speaking, not all of the symbols used are strictly accurate, but as long as we are consistent with ourselves we can learn to pronounce the sounds accurately.) A few of the symbols may look strange at first but you should get used to them fairly quickly. Remember, don't assume that you know what a letter should say. Learn the pronunciation by listening to and repeating our teachers.

### Vowel sounds
The first seven vowels below are the seven basic vowels of Mongolian. (See the section on Mongolian writing.)

| Sound | Listen | Sample words | Listen |
|---|---|---|---|
| ɑ | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Vowel-1-a.mp3" /> | ɑːb (father), ʧɑg (time) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-vowels-words-1a.mp3" /> |
| ə | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Vowel-2-e.mp3" /> | təgəːd (then), dəːr (before) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-vowels-words-2e.mp3" /> |
| i | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Vowel-3-i.mp3" /> | ʃin (new), ʧiniː (your) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-vowels-words-3i.mp3" /> |
| ɔ | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Vowel-4-o.mp3" /> | tɔm (big), mɔŋgə̌l | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-vowels-words-4o.mp3" /> |
| ʊ | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Vowel-5-u.mp3" /> | bʊruː (wrong), sʊː (sit) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-vowels-words-5u.mp3" /> |
| o | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Vowel-6-o.mp3" /> | oːr (other), ondə̌g (egg) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-vowels-words-6o.mp3" /> |
| u | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Vowel-7-u.mp3" /> | juː (what), səruːn (cool) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-vowels-words-7u.mp3" /> |
| æ | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Vowel-8-ae.mp3" /> | sæn (good), ʧæː (tea) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-vowels-words-8ae.mp3" /> |
| e | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Vowel-9-ei.mp3" /> | əərə̌gteː (male), ugue (not) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-vowels-words-9e.mp3" /> |
| œ | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Vowel-10-oe.mp3" /> | œːms (socks), mœr (horse) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-vowels-words-10oe.mp3" /> |

It should also be noted that /i/ is sometimes also pronounced /ɪ/ (the sound in the English word "sit"), but we will just use one symbol for both sounds.

### Long Vowels vs. Short Vowels
The length of the vowel sound matters in Mongolian. It can change the meaning of a word. Listen to the difference between long and short vowel sounds.

| Long | Short | Listen |
|---|---|---|
| ʧɑːs (paper) | ʧɑs (snow) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-long-short-words-1a.mp3" /> |
| dəːr (above) | dər (pillow) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-long-short-words-2e.mp3" /> |
| biːr (pen) | ir (blade) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-long-short-words-3i.mp3" /> |
| xɔːl (food) | xɔl (far) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-long-short-words-4o.mp3" /> |
| ʊːl (mountain) | ʊl (sole) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-long-short-words-5u.mp3" /> |
| oːr (other) | orə̌m (milk skin) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-long-short-words-6o.mp3" /> |
| uːd (door) | ud (noon) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-long-short-words-7u.mp3" /> |
| æːl (village) | æl (which) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-long-short-words-8ae.mp3" /> |
| xœːn (after) | xœn (sheep) | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-long-short-words-9oe.mp3" /> |

<a name="weak-vowels"></a>
### Weak vowels
The last syllable of a word often has a week vowel sound. Although commonly stressed, it is very short and indistinct. The sound differs slightly according to the vowel in the syllable before it, but for simplicity's sake we are going to use just one symbol to represent this week vowel sound. I've noticed that on some computers this symbol does not display correctly. (It should look like an up-side-down e with a smile on top.) If so, you may need to install a Unicode font on your computer. [You can get directions here.](http://www.unicode.org/help/display_problems.html)

| Sound | Listen | Sample words |
|---|---|---|
| ə̌ | <AudioPlayer src="/audio/Pronunciation-weak-vowels-words.mp3" /> | tɑːnə̌r, sœnə̌n, ɔrə̌s, dəbtə̌r, udə̌ʃ, omə̌n, irə̌x, bæːʃə̌ŋ |

### Diphthongs
These are sounds formed by a combination of two different vowels.
