# Anki Flashcards

Anki is arguably the best program out there to help you memorize new information, certainly the best one I have ever seen. It uses a spaced repetition algorithm. That means if a vocabulary word is new or difficult then you will review it often. But if it is easy then you only review it infrequently. That makes sense. Why waste your time going over words that you already know? I have used Anki extensively when learning Chinese. Now I want to apply it to Mongolian.

The desktop application is free for Linux, Windows, and Mac. The smart phone app is free for Android phones but there is a charge for the iPhone app. Believe me, it is worth the price, though. I used Anki on my first smart phone and if I hadn’t used the phone for anything else, it still would have been worth the price of the phone. It is so convenient to just be practicing vocabulary when you are out and about. Anyway, this is all available from [ankisrs.net](http://ankisrs.net/). Also, if you sign up for a free account with [AnkiWeb](http://ankiweb.net/) then you can sync your flashcards across your devices.

I am slowly adding more decks for studying Mongolian. You can check back from time to time to see if there are any new ones. If you have a request for a deck then leave a comment below. Or better yet, if you want to help me make some decks I will provide you with all the resources.

Download the Anki deck package using the link below. After you install Anki on your computer or smart phone, select import from the menu to add the flashcard deck. You may need to put it in a special folder, but the program should tell you. If you need help, the manual is [here](http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html). And if you have access to YouTube, [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS2G-k2hQyg&feature=plcp) is a nice overview video on using Anki.
