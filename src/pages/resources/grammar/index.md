# Grammar

For an in depth study of grammar you should check out the book *Mongolian Grammar* by Rita Kullmann and D. Tserenpil. You should be able to find it with a Google search.

I never got very far here. I may come back to this some day but this is all there is for now. If this is something you are interested in working on then contact me.
